#### What is AKcess?
AKcess ID is a digital identity that turns your mobile phone into your identification tool. It is so secure that banks can rely on it. The person’s identity is encrypted, hashed and then immutably written to the blockchain, where it can be verified on the fly. Users choose who and when can access different parts of their identity. 
AKcess ID’s distributed architecture resolves the competing challenges of transparency and privacy, resulting in faster customer onboarding, lower costs, and enhanced compliance through a single, trusted and consistent view of customer reference data. At the same time, AKcess ID has zero knowledge of users’ personal account.

#### Use Cases:
• Identity storage, authentication to data storage
• User control of personal identity services
• Trust assurance for customer privacy
• Enables regulatory compliance for financial institutions, corporate clients & identity partners
• Applications can request permissions from users and then gain read-and-write access to user resources
• Digital passport / Digital certificates
• Register your valuables
